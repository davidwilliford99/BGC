                    <p className='py-2 font-["Montserrat"] tracking-tight'> At The Bone Graft Consortium , we 
                        lift the veil of mismanaged, 
                        misrepresented, and misunderstood 
                        grafting categories so HCPs can easily 
                        and quickly make an informed decision. 
                        With seats on our board filled by 
                        executives from major grafting 
                        manufacturers, KOLs, insurance providers,
                        as well as small, biologic only companies, the BGC is the only 
                        completely comprehensive resource demanded by hospital systems and 
                        providers alike, in order to make an informed decision based on facts, 
                        not marketing, for best practices and patient specific needs.</p>

                    <p className='py-2 font-["Montserrat"] tracking-tight tracking-tight'>Not all bone graft is created equally, nor should it have to be. 
                        At the Bone Graft Consortium(BGC) we help to take the guess work(and marketing 
                        confusion) out of the crowded bone grafting space.</p>

                    <p className='py-2 font-["Montserrat"] tracking-tight'>The fact based information provided by the BGC allows your hospital or ASC to make 
                        an informed decision, in a reasonable amount of time, as to the most relevant bone 
                        grafts for your institutionâ€™s requirements. This not only helps the hospital, provider, 
                        and patient workflow but it also allows companies to know their place in the queue, without 
                        waiting an undetermined amount of time for a possible approval or denial based on non factual 
                        vetting processes(current value analysis systems across our country).</p>
